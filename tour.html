      <h2>‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice Age Retreat</h2>
      <p>The Ice Age is retreating but we can still travel when earth is a snowball here what we gonna do.</p>
     <ul>
  <li><p>1. We spawn in the Early Holocene, around 11,700 years ago, right after the Ice Age ends the air is warmer and the last glaciers are melting away.</p></li>
  <li><p>2. We set up our new base camp near a lush river valley close to the equator full of greenery, forests, and wild animals returning to the land.</p></li>
  <li><p>3. Everyone grabs their gear, cameras, and food supplies we‚Äôll be exploring massive changes in land, water, life, and climate during this age of rebirth.</p></li>
  <li><p>4. We hop into the <strong>GlaZaCar 3.0</strong> upgraded for warm climates and start moving north to see the retreating glaciers carving deep valleys and new rivers.</p></li>
  <li><p>5. First stop: giant herds of animals! We‚Äôll spot <strong>bison, reindeer, aurochs (wild cattle), woolly mammoths still surviving in small groups, and saber-tooth cats fading from the land</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p>6. As we move into forested zones, keep your eyes out for early <strong>bears, moose, elk, and wild horses</strong> exploring newly thawed forests.</p></li>
  <li><p>7. We visit the first human camps <strong>hunter-gatherers building homes from wood and bone</strong>, using stone tools and fire, painting caves, and learning to domesticate dogs and goats.</p></li>
  <li><p>8. Next, we teleport to the Middle Holocene! The climate is warmer than ever ‚Äî lush forests stretch across Europe, Asia, and North America, and grasslands fill Africa.</p></li>
  <li><p>9. We travel across great river valleys the <strong>Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus, and Yellow River</strong> and watch humans starting to <strong>farm, irrigate, and form early villages</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p>10. Wildlife is thriving: <strong>elephants, lions, hippos, crocodiles, and giant deer</strong> live beside humans; the megafauna era is ending, but nature is still full of giants.</p></li>
  <li><p>11. We‚Äôll visit <strong>early farmers</strong> planting wheat, barley, and rice, and <strong>shepherds domesticating sheep and cattle</strong>. Humanity is learning to settle down.</p></li>
  <li><p>12. The tour continues with a flyover of massive floodplains and deltas forming the seas rise to nearly modern levels, and coastlines take shape around the world.</p></li>
  <li><p>13. Optional adventure stop: visit <strong>G√∂bekli Tepe</strong> one of the world‚Äôs first temples where ancient people carved stone pillars and worshiped under the stars.</p></li>
  <li><p>14. Before heading back to camp, we take a short group exploration using our <strong>Teleporter Pods</strong> to visit early villages in Mesopotamia, China, and Africa and record their daily lives.</p></li>
  <li><p>15. Finally, we return to camp for dinner around the fire, watching the sunset over fertile plains a world fully awake after the long Ice Age. Get ready for our next stop: the rise of civilizations!</p></li>
